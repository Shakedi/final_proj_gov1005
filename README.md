# Happiness Freedom and Gender Inequality

Project Website: https://shakedleibovitz.shinyapps.io/happiness_gender_inequality/

My project explores levels of gender inequality in different countries all over the world, and the relation to the happiness in that country and the perceived freedom to make life choices.
To measure the level of gender inequality I examined the percent agreement to inequaity statements from the World Value Survey (Wave 7). To measure the level of happiness and freedom to make life choices I used the World Happiness Report.
The general trend observed from my data analysis is that countries in which their citizend tend to agree more with inequality statements, tend to be less happy, and usually have a lower score for perceived freedom. Which is observed both in males and females, although more significant for females.
